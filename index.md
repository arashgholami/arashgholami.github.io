              I am currently a Research Fellow in school of Computer Science, Carnegie Mellon University. I received my PhD from the EECS Department at University of California Irvine. I am recipient of 2018 "IEEE Communications Society and Information Theory Society" Joint best Paper Award and 2014 "IEEE Globecom" best paper award. I study Probability Theory, Information Theory, Statistics and Algorithms.

               <font style="font-size:13px">A conjecture made by Lapidoth et al. at Allerton 2005 (also an open problem presented at ITA 2006) states that the degrees of freedom (DoF) of a two user broadcast channel, where the transmitter is equipped with two antennas and each user is equipped with one antenna, must collapse under finite precision channel state information at the transmitter (CSIT). That this conjecture, which predates interference alignment, has remained unresolved, is emblematic of a pervasive lack of understanding of the DoF of wireless networks-including interference and X networks-under channel uncertainty at the transmitter(s). In this paper, we prove that the conjecture is true in all non-degenerate settings (e.g., where the probability density function of unknown channel coefficients exists and is bounded). This also settles a related recent conjecture by Tandon et al. We are also able to generalize the result to the collapse of DoF to unity under non-degenerate channel uncertainty for the general K-user interference and M Ã— N user X networks as well. </font><br>

            <font style="font-size:13px">Sum-set inequalities specialized to the generalized degrees of freedom (GDoF)
framework are presented in this paper. These are information theoretic lower bounds on the entropy of bounded density
linear combinations of discrete, power-limited dependent random variables in terms of the joint
entropies of arbitrary linear combinations of new random variables that are obtained by power
level partitioning of the original random variables. </font><br>

            <font style="font-size:13px">In this paper, we consider the problem of classification of M high dimensional queries to N high dimensional classes  where A and B are discrete alphabets and the probabilistic model that relates data to the classes P(x,y) is known. The problem is analogous  to the  nearest neighbor search problem, where the goal is to find the data point in a database that is the most similar to a query point. To solve our high dimensional classification problem, we introduce distribution sensitive hashes that map jointly generated pairs (x,y)~P  to the same bucket with probability higher than random pairs x~P^X and y~P^Y, where  P^X and P^Y are the marginal probability distributions of P. We design distribution sensitive hashes using a forest of decision trees and we show that the complexity of search grows with $O(N^lambda(P))$ where $lambda(P)$ is expressed in an analytical form. We further show that the proposed hashes perform faster than state of the art approximate nearest neighbor search methods for a range of probability distributions, in both theory and simulations. </font><br>
